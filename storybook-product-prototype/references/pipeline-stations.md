# Pipeline Stations

Use this reference to see where a skill sits in the prototype-to-production chain, what each station consumes and produces, and which gate must pass before the next station starts. It is the shared map for `storybook-product-prototype`, `frontend-product-implementation`, `native-product-implementation`, and `production-data-integration`.

## The Six Stations

| # | Station | Owner | Input | Output | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Prototype authoring | `storybook-product-prototype` | Product intent, design-system source, existing components | Prototype folder, seven handoff docs, fixtures (`.ts` + `fixtures/*.json`), flow metadata, Storybook stories | `validate_prototype.py`, project typecheck, Storybook build |
| 2 | Team demo confirmation | The product team (human) | The Storybook story and UI Flow | `Review Status: confirmed` with reviewer, date, and covered scope | **Human gate.** No automation passes this station |
| 3 | Handoff finalization | `storybook-product-prototype` | Confirmed docs | `docs/HANDOFF_MANIFEST.json`, optional `docs/TOKENS.json` and `docs/flow.json` | `validate_prototype.py --handoff-ready` (placeholder sweep, doc↔code cross-checks, acceptance ids, confirmed Review Status) |
| 4 | Frontend assembly, mock mode | `frontend-product-implementation` (web) / `native-product-implementation` (iOS, Android) | Manifest, docs, `TOKENS.json`, `fixtures/*.json`, JSON Schemas | Production routes/screens, typed `<Feature>DataSource` + mock, `IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md` | design-system governance gates, mock-mode flow walkthrough, `validate_implementation.py`, framework-native build/test |
| 5 | Data integration | `production-data-integration` | Contracts with `Semantics`, Data Adapter Seams, fixtures, JSON Schemas | Real clients/auth/cache/persistence, swapped injection points, contract tests | Contract tests per fixture group, every `AC-P (integration)` criterion settled |
| 6 | Visual and acceptance QA | `ui-pixel-align-report`, `ui-compare-to-reference` | Running production build, prototype Storybook | Pixel-alignment evidence, applied visual fixes, completed traceability | Every Scope `B` surface compared, acceptance traceability fully resolved |

## The Platform Fork

The fork sits **after station 3**, not before it. Stations 1–3 are platform-neutral: PRD, flow state machine, acceptance criteria, JSON Schemas, and DTCG tokens describe the product, not a runtime. One handoff, one manifest, one confirmation.

From station 4 on, the execution skill differs by target:

- Web (React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, meta-frameworks) → `frontend-product-implementation`
- iOS SwiftUI and Android Compose → `native-product-implementation`

Both consume the same documents through the same gates and produce the same `IMPLEMENTATION_MAP.md` shape, so station 5 and station 6 do not care which branch produced the app. When a product ships on more than one platform, run station 4 once per platform against the same manifest, and read the `Scope(web)` / `Scope(app)` columns — a region that already ships on web is routinely new on app.

## Gate Rules That Cross Stations

- **Nothing skips station 2.** `--handoff-ready` fails while `Review Status` is `pending`, and every station-4 skill re-checks the status at ingestion. Docs that bypassed the validator do not bypass the receiving check.
- **The manifest pins the version.** Station 4 records the consumed `docsDigest`; `--verify-manifest` at the prototype and `validate_implementation.py` at the implementation both detect a handoff that moved underneath an in-flight implementation.
- **Scope travels verbatim.** The `A`/`B`/`C`/`U` classification is authored once at station 1–3 and copied, never re-derived, at station 4. `A` needs repo evidence; `U` is a blocking question.
- **Acceptance ids travel end to end.** `AC-S-*` is settled at station 1, `AC-H-*` at station 3, `AC-P (assembly)` at station 4's mock walkthrough, and `AC-P (integration)` at station 5. Station 6 confirms the table is fully resolved.
- **Data wiring never happens before station 5.** Station 4 delivers a replaceable seam and hands the replacement to the named owner in `Data Integration Ownership`.

## Encoding The Pipeline For Re-runs

`agent-automation-orchestrate` can encode these stations as an ordered, resumable task contract. The example below is a template: replace every placeholder command with the project's real command, and treat that skill's own config contract as authoritative for the schema.

```jsonc
// .agent-automation/config.json — template, adapt per project

    }
  ]
}
```

Notes on the template:

- Station 2 stays a human stop. Automating it defeats the confirmation it exists to record.
- `native-assembly` is marked optional so a web-only project runs the same config unchanged; a native-only project marks `frontend-assembly` optional instead.
- Every station-4 branch depends on `handoff-finalization`, so a re-run after a prototype change re-derives the manifest before any implementation restarts.
- Station 5 depends on whichever station-4 branch produced the app under integration; list both when both ship.
