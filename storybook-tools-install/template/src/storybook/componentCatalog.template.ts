 * Component catalog — the Component Coverage Analyzer's source of truth about

 * project's components and stories, replaces the example entries below with
 * real ones, and saves the result as `src/storybook/componentCatalog.ts`.
 * See references/catalog-authoring.md in the skill for entry-writing rules.
 *
 * Contract consumed by src/storybook/component-coverage/ — these exports must
 * keep their names and shapes:
 *   componentCatalog, componentCatalogEntries,
 *   ComponentCatalogId, ComponentDocumentationProvenance
 *
 * Parsing contract: the check scripts (scripts/check-component-catalog.mjs,
 * scripts/check-component-coverage-reports.mjs) parse this file with regexes.
 * Keep `id` as the FIRST field of every entry and keep the string fields
 * (`id`, `name`, `storyTitle`, `componentPath`) each on a single line.
